Does it have to feature characters identifiable as Jews? If artists who identify as Jews—actors, directors, screenwriters, composers—play significant roles in a film's production does that make it Jewish? Our primary point of entry into these questions will be Hollywood, from the industry's early silent films, through the period generally considered classical, down to the present day. We will also study films produced overseas, in countries that may include Israel, Egypt, France, Italy, and Germany. Our discussions will be enriched by contextual material drawn from film studies, cultural studies, Jewish studies, American studies, and other related fields. Students will be expected to view a significant number of films outside of class—an average of one per week—and engage with them through writing and in-class discussion.

The universality of biomedicine, or hospital medicine, will not be taken for granted, but rather we will examine the plurality generated by the various political, economic, social, and ethical demands under which biomedicine has developed in different places and at different times. In addition, biomedical healing and expertise will be viewed in relation to other kinds of healing and expertise. Our readings will address medicine in North America as well as other parts of the world.

Through a close examination of ethnographies, intellectual histories, and religious treatises, we will analyze the key debates and discourses surrounding the intersection of gender and Islam. We begin by investigating Quranic revelations and hadith concerning gender and sexual ethics, female figures of emulation in early Islam, and feminist exegeses of the Quran. Continuing onward, we focus upon the everyday lives of Muslim women and non-binary individuals in medieval, colonial, and post-colonial contexts, highlighting the ways in which people negotiate and respond to the sexual politics of the times in which they live as we ask what, if anything, is specifically ""Islamic"" about the situations under discussion? Following this, we embark upon a history of sexuality within Islam, tracing the ways in which the categories of ""homosexuality"" and ""heterosexuality"" came to exist in the Muslim world, as well as the history and positionality of trans communities past and present. We then continue with an exploration of Islamic feminism as it exists today, looking to the ways in which Muslim feminists have critically engaged both religious texts as well as Western feminist theory.

This common expression captures a widespread belief about objects' roles in human lives, but deciphering what objects have to say is actually a complex cultural process. An object rarely has a single meaning; they are read variously in different cultural settings, and even by different individuals within a cultural system. How does one know, can one know, the meanings of an object? How are objects strategically deployed in social interaction, particularly in cross-cultural interactions where each side may have radically different understandings?

This class explores the generativity of broken worlds. It considers the question of brokenness through analyzing thwarted infrastructures across the globe that give rise to the impulse of repair of our everyday social, material, political, and affective lives. Broken infrastructures can, indeed, afford various reparative affects, practices and spaces. Yet, to repair means that not only humans, but also nonhumans, such as plants or animals, can emerge as infrastructures of repair in their own right. This class then emerges from the idea that we are restorative species, constantly engaged in mending and fixing of broken material and affective worlds. The course ends by reffllflecting on the reparative potential of researchers. For longer description and instructor bio visit the Society for the Humanities website.",,Spring.,ANTHR 7469,,,,,,,

Our goal for this course is to delve into the diversity and complexity of transformations that shaped life in Africa and beyond. As the birthplace of humankind African archaeology extends back at least 2.5 million years, however our story starts in the Middle and Late Stone Age when we see some of the earliest evidence of symbolic thought, art, and shifts in food procurement strategies at the beginning of the Holocene 10,000 years ago. We will examine Africa's rich archaeological past from the development of food production, metallurgy, monumental architecture, urbanism and social and political complexity, religious movements, large-scale webs of trade and exchange and through the forceful absorption into European and Arab colonial empires, and trans-oceanic diasporas. Africa's past and Africa today is often misrepresented and misunderstood in popular news media and in our imaginations. Throughout the course we will be discussing the politics and ethics of doing archaeology in post-colonial Africa for African archaeologists and local communities and for archeologists coming from Euro-western countries.

The involvement of Latin American artists with modern media technologies dates at least to the late nineteenth century and has especially flourished in the last three decades. The canonical histories and criticism of Latin American art for the most part depict a history of artistic production in which technology plays a minor or invisible role. This construction of history reinforces the assumption that experimentation, innovation, and theorization in technological art are exclusive provinces of the developed world. As the history of art expands to include diverse areas of media arts and visual culture, the recognition of Latin American artists' involvement with technology is not only overdue but also essential to the development of more diverse and rigorous understandings of both modernity and modernism.",,Spring.,ARTH 4155,,,,,,,

When, why, and how did humans distinguish themselves from animals? Ancient Greco-Roman and Christian attitudes towards animals are sometimes held responsible for a string divide between the species. This seminar tries to investigate the complexities of their relationship. As Greek and Roman societies relied fundamentally on hunting and agriculture, animals constituted a crucial point of reference in their conception of the world. Animals occupied different functions and roles for humans, such as foe or protector and companion, food and resource, sacrificial victim, subject and object of prodigies, but also status symbol, pet, object of entertainment, of scientific study etc. At the same time, many animals had a divine side to them. We will look at how the different forms of interaction between humans and animals resulted from man's views of other species and how the interactions themselves helped shape these views. We will investigate written sources covering the whole range of literary genres, visual, and archaeological material.

Maps allow us to move through space, but they do so by abstracting space to its barest aspects—an act of reduction that has historically served to eliminate Indigenous inhabitants, ecological entanglements, non-spatial elements, and countless other features of our lived environment. This course posits remapping as an act of repair, a means of correcting some of the reductive tendencies of maps. Moving between the history of cartography, particularly as it appears in Cornell's extensive Map Collection, and a study of artistic critiques of the map, we will develop a critical vocabulary for assessing cartographic practice and explore new tools for imagining it otherwise. For longer description and instructor bio visit the Society for the Humanities website.",,Spring.,ARTH 4620,,,,,,,

With the advent of Western and American colonialism and imperialism, coupled with recent successes in westernization by the Japanese, Chinese artists had to redefine their roles as well as their visions.

This seminar will analyze the interactions between academically sanctioned disciplines (such as iconography and connoisseurship) and innovations coming from philosophy, psychoanalysis, historiography, sociology, literary theory, mass media criticism, feminism, and Marxism. We will try especially to develop: (1) a general theory of ""visual ideology"" (the gender, social, racial, and class determinations on the production, consumption, and appropriation of visual artifacts under modern and postmodern conditions); and (2) contemporary theoretical practices that articulate these determinations. Examples will be drawn from the history of oil painting, architecture, city planning, photography, film, and other mass media.",,Spring.,ARTH 6060,,,,,,,
529,ARTH,6155,Topics in Latin American Art,Maria Fernandez,02:40PM,04:35PM,To Be Assigned,"Topic: Latin American Modernisms and Technology. The involvement of Latin American artists with modern media technologies dates at least to the late nineteenth century and has especially flourished in the last three decades. The canonical histories and criticism of Latin American art for the most part depict a history of artistic production in which technology plays a minor or invisible role. This construction of history reinforces the assumption that experimentation, innovation, and theorization in technological art are exclusive provinces of the developed world. As the history of art expands to include diverse areas of media arts and visual culture, the recognition of Latin American artists' involvement with technology is not only overdue but also essential to the development of more diverse and rigorous understandings of both modernity and modernism.",,Spring.,ARTH 6155,,,,,,,
530,ARTH,6160,Topics in Colonial Encounters,Ananda Cohen-Aponte,11:20AM,01:15PM,To Be Assigned,"The colonial period in Latin America (circa 1521-1820s) witnessed the formation of one of the most diverse societies in the world.  Labor regimes, religious activities, marriage alliances, and commercial contacts engendered by the Spanish colonial enterprise brought Spaniards, Africans, and Indigenous peoples into dynamic contact.  This cross-fertilization of cultures resulted in the construction of new cultural categories and colonial identities whose reverberations continue to be felt into the present day.  This seminar explores the role that visual culture played in the articulation of identity in Latin America.  For the purposes of this seminar, ""identity"" can be loosely defined as the overlapping allegiances to which one ascribes, whether racial, cultural, gendered, religious, or community-based.  The visual culture of colonial Latin America can reveal multitudes on the construction of self and community across temporal and geographical contexts.  We will explore a variety of colonial Latin American objects and images, including paintings, textiles, and material culture.  Our discussions of images will be guided by readings on hybridity, coloniality, cross-cultural exchange, and the early modern Atlantic world.",,Spring.,ARTH 6160,,,,,,,

When, why, and how did humans distinguish themselves from animals? Ancient Greco-Roman and Christian attitudes towards animals are sometimes held responsible for a string divide between the species. This seminar tries to investigate the complexities of their relationship. As Greek and Roman societies relied fundamentally on hunting and agriculture, animals constituted a crucial point of reference in their conception of the world. Animals occupied different functions and roles for humans, such as foe or protector and companion, food and resource, sacrificial victim, subject and object of prodigies, but also status symbol, pet, object of entertainment, of scientific study etc. At the same time, many animals had a divine side to them. We will look at how the different forms of interaction between humans and animals resulted from man's views of other species and how the interactions themselves helped shape these views. We will investigate written sources covering the whole range of literary genres, visual, and archaeological material. Readings will also include texts on the modern debate on the relationship between humans and animals and the posthuman.",,Spring.,ARTH 6233,,,,,,,

533,ARTH,6560,Aesthetic Theory: The End of Art,Peter Gilgen,02:40PM,04:35PM,To Be Assigned,"This course investigates the emergence of aesthetics as its own philosophical discipline at the end of the eighteenth century.  In a first phase, we will examine the rationalist articulation of aesthetics in Baumgarten's work and the empiricist theory of taste, particularly Burke's Enquiry.  Drawing on the findings of these two traditions, Kant's Critique of Judgment (1790) inaugurated a preoccupation in German philosophy around 1800 with the philosophical status of the beautiful and of art.  Especially in Romantic theory and practice, art was meant to provide a solution to the philosophical dilemmas in the wake of Kant's critical philosophy.  However, already in Hegel's Phenomenology, and more explicitly in the Encyclopedia and the Lectures on Aesthetics, art lost this elevated position vis-à-vis philosophy.  Taking this observation as a guiding thread, the main part of the course is structured around in-depth readings that may include Kant, Schiller, Schelling, the Schlegels, Novalis, Hölderlin, and Hegel.  Further readings may include writings by contemporary philosophers and theoreticians--such as Adorno, Allison, Danto, Deleuze, Derrida, Ginsborg, Guyer, Lyotard et al.--whose work on aesthetics takes its starting point from the philosophical issues surrounding the emergence of aesthetic theory only to transcend these historical confines and formulate contemporary positions on the status of the aesthetic and of art.  The following questions will be addressed: What are the conditions for the move from the subjective judgment of taste (Kant) to objective beauty (Romantics, Hegel)?  How is the relation of art and nature reconceived by the Romantics?  What is the relation of aesthetic theory and the history of art?  Is philosophy the end of art?",,Spring.,ARTH 6560,,,,,,,

Maps allow us to move through space, but they do so by abstracting space to its barest aspects—an act of reduction that has historically served to eliminate Indigenous inhabitants, ecological entanglements, non-spatial elements, and countless other features of our lived environment. This course posits remapping as an act of repair, a means of correcting some of the reductive tendencies of maps. Moving between the history of cartography, particularly as it appears in Cornell's extensive Map Collection, and a study of artistic critiques of the map, we will develop a critical vocabulary for assessing cartographic practice and explore new tools for imagining it otherwise. For longer description and instructor bio visit the Society for the Humanities website.",,Spring.,ARTH 6620,,,,,,,

This course considers these questions within the context of China's unprecedented urban transformation at the turn of the 21st century, paying attention to the ways in which art and architecture are at once resistant to and at the same time entangled with capitalist and governmental forces. From Beijing's Tiananmen Square to Guangzhou's skyscraper construction sites; from virtual cities to New York City—a center of the Chinese diaspora—we will look transregionally at how different types of urban spaces prompted new aesthetic forms and how such creative acts contributed, in turn, to the transformation of these very spaces.",,Spring.,ARTH 6803,,,,,,,

553,ASIAN,2291,Engendering China,Yue Du,09:40AM,10:55AM,To Be Assigned,"In contemporary China, as in many other places of the world, the ideology and social reality of gender relations is highly paradoxical. Women are flattered for their power as consumers and commitment to the family while they are also expected to engage in wage-earning employment. Men, on the other hand, face constant pressure of being tough and social problems such as costly betrothal gifts as unintended consequences of a gender regime that is supposedly male-oriented. Are these paradoxes a betrayal of the socialist experiment of erasing gender differences? Are they remnants of China's long imperial tradition? This course explores the power dynamics of gender relations in China from ancient times to the present. It leads students to examine scholarship that challenges the popularly accepted myth of lineal progression of China toward gender equality, and to understand women's and men's life choices in various historical settings. At the same time, this course guides students to adopt ""gender"" as a useful analytical category, treating China as a case study through which students are trained to ""engender"" any society past and present.",,Spring.,ASIAN 2291,,,,,,,

We will examine both historical examples, and the barbarians of today -- the terrorists and insurgents so often framed as dark and primitive, in contrast with ourselves. Through readings and visual materials, we will seek to discover what these barbarians have in common.

Asia scholars have laid claim to the historical, to modernity, coloniality, postcoloniality, religion, affect, temporality, race, capital, (mass) media, embodiment, the translocal, and the posthuman as the bases for producing conceptual difference. Each of these switchpoints has allowed for valuable interventions from Asian Studies into the humanities and social sciences. We will develop questions, criteria, and critiques to thoroughly test our tools of analysis and work toward yet other methods. Contemporary academia valorizes the production of conceptual difference. Thus, evaluation criteria routinely include originality and innovation. This is a valuable point of departure that allows us to ask, What kind of conceptual difference do we want to produce in our work? What kind of conceptual difference is intellectually rigorous? Asia as Question does not merely provide intellectual history but rather tests out—and creates—contemporary, critical approaches. As such, it interrogates especially notions of region and area; work on temporality; new ontologies; and current approaches to media ecologies. ",,Spring.,ASIAN 6622,,,,,,,

The recent interest in the Sinitic in premodern East Asia rejects the centrality of Sinitic texts and their one-directional impact. Instead, it reconstructs the thriving diversity of the translingual practices attuned to local specificities, redefining the so-called Sinosphere as much more multidirectional than a political and diplomatic hierarchy would permit. Reexamining the perception of the Sinitic as the unifying force that coalesced the various countries and cultures of East Asia into a single Sinographic zone, we will delve into the ways in which uneven assemblages of local production and circulation unfolded in various regions brought into contact with one another. The major topics include the transborder movement of books and objects; appropriation of Confucian themes and ideas; translations, adaptations, and intertextuality; multilingual texts and reading practices; the formation and dissemination of knowledge; and transoceanic exchanges.",Prerequisite: At least two years of classical Chinese is necessary.,Spring.,ASIAN 6627,,,,,,,

In this course we will address such questions by looking at how different civilizations have imagined their barbarians, ranging from their key role in Greek drama, and as infidels in religious conceptions, to Chinese walls, and American savagery. We will examine both historical examples, and the barbarians of today -- the terrorists and insurgents so often framed as dark and primitive, in contrast with ourselves. Through readings and visual materials, we will seek to discover what these barbarians have in common. We will look comparatively for the underlying patterns of history that the barbarians are drafted from, to draw a new picture of the barbarians. At the same time, we will arrive at a new understanding of civilization as such, as well as of the general nature of human inequality, and how it is justified.   ","Prerequisite: some familiarity with issues and debates in anthropology, and/or social sciences generally.",Spring.,ASIAN 6632,,,,,,,

Disgraced officials are sent to far-flung provinces, loyalists to past regimes hide out across China's borders, and dissidents have their entry visas revoked, making it impossible for them to return home. The experiences of these people, and the poems and stories they write, tell us a great deal about what it means and how it feels to be included and excluded. What is the difference between the way China looks from the inside and the way it looks from the outside? Who has the power to decide who gets to live in China, and how and why do they use it?

Leading U.S. historians circulated a petition outlining its perceived inaccuracies; and the project even earned a presidential rebuke resulting in the founding of the 1776 Commission, an advisory designed to challenge the project's key arguments about the nation's founding. In both instances the critiques were not merely about the content of ""1619,"" they were also about who gets to write history and for what purpose. Reading the ""1619 Project"" alongside historical writing published in both academic and popular mediums, this seminar will explore how issues like audience, interpretation, and evidence shape the process of historical writing.",,Spring.,ASRC 1899,,,,,,,

Emphasis is placed on the philosophies of black nationalism, Pan Africanism and anticolonialism and the themes of emigration, expatriation, repatriation and exile. Awareness of Africa and attitudes toward the continent and its peoples have profoundly shaped African-American identity, culture and political consciousness. Notions of a linked fate between Africans and black Americans have long influenced black life and liberation struggles within the U.S. The motives, purposes and outlooks of African-American theorists who have claimed political, cultural, or spiritual connection to Africa and Africans have varied widely, though they have always powerfully reflected black experiences in America and in the West. The complexity and dynamism of those views belie simplistic assumptions about essential or ""natural"" relationships, and invite critical contemplation of the myriad roles that Africa has played in the African-American mind.""",,Spring.,ASRC 2354,,,,,,,

Johnson, Jacob Lawrence, Archibald Motley, and Palmer Hayden, and musicians such as Duke Ellington and Bessie Smith.  We will read selected writings on Harlem from Malcolm X, Ralph Ellison and Chester Himes, and study the recent fictions by Mat Johnson, Colson Whitehead, Sapphire, Karla FC Holloway and A'Lelia Bundles.  We will draw on a range of media and technology, including resources based at the Library of Congress such as ""Drop Me Off in Harlem"" and ""Guide to Harlem Renaissance Materials,"" along with contemporary photographic projects such as Gayatri Spivak and Alice Attie's Harlem and Harlem:  A Century in Images by Deborah Willis and several co-authors.  ",,Spring.,ASRC 4508,,,,,,,

In China, Maoism holds the key to the enduring success of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), one of the most remarkable organizations of the 20th and 21st centuries that has survived the collapse of communism in Europe and the USSR. With the beneficial transformation brought by capitalism and globalization in China, the end of the Cold War and the narrative of the ""end of history"" cannot explain the resurgence of Maoism.",,Spring.,CAPS 2435,,,,,,,

In the name of the Women's liberation movement since the early 1900s, do Chinese women eventually hold up the half sky? From the cradle to the grave, what was most challenging in women's life? How did political, economic, and cultural forces frame women's professional careers and private life? No judgments nor imaginations. Using multi-media, such as Chinese independent documentary films, music, and photographs, students will discover the hidden stories behind the mainstream narratives.

911,CAPS,2932,Engendering China,Yue Du,09:40AM,10:55AM,To Be Assigned,"In contemporary China, as in many other places of the world, the ideology and social reality of gender relations is highly paradoxical. Women are flattered for their power as consumers and commitment to the family while they are also expected to engage in wage-earning employment. Men, on the other hand, face constant pressure of being tough and social problems such as costly betrothal gifts as unintended consequences of a gender regime that is supposedly male-oriented. Are these paradoxes a betrayal of the socialist experiment of erasing gender differences? Are they remnants of China's long imperial tradition? This course explores the power dynamics of gender relations in China from ancient times to the present. It leads students to examine scholarship that challenges the popularly accepted myth of lineal progression of China toward gender equality, and to understand women's and men's life choices in various historical settings. At the same time, this course guides students to adopt ""gender"" as a useful analytical category, treating China as a case study through which students are trained to ""engender"" any society past and present.",,Spring.,CAPS 2932,,,,,,,
912,CAPS,3329,Literature of Leaving China,Nick Admussen,09:40AM,10:55AM,To Be Assigned,"Ever since the creation of the concept of a culturally and geographically stable center in China, people have been intentionally excluded from that center. Disgraced officials are sent to far-flung provinces, loyalists to past regimes hide out across China's borders, and dissidents have their entry visas revoked, making it impossible for them to return home. The experiences of these people, and the poems and stories they write, tell us a great deal about what it means and how it feels to be included and excluded. What is the difference between the way China looks from the inside and the way it looks from the outside? Who has the power to decide who gets to live in China, and how and why do they use it? What is the relationship between our identities and our homes? Texts studied will range from 300 BCE to the present; all will be read and discussed in English. ",,Spring.,CAPS 3329,,,,,,,

Substantively, there is hardly a profession or sector where what happens inside China does not touch upon or impact what happens outside China. Throughout this course, we will grapple with ongoing debates over China's rise and whether policies of engagement with China have succeeded or failed. These debates are unfolding in many different communities and idea marketplaces, across many different modes and styles of analysis and writing. Each of the reading and writing assignments are aimed at developing literacy and proficiency in three different modes of analysis and writing about China: academic, policy, and journalistic. While many courses provide introductions to different aspects of China, and many seminars examine more specialized questions at even deeper levels, there are few that directly invite students to examine and explore the different ways in which scholars and professionals have written about and come to understand China.",,Spring.,CAPS 4502,,,,,,,

In transportation engineering, these models allow researchers, firms, and policy-makers to predict demand for new alternatives and infrastructure (e.g. a light rail or a new highway), to analyze the market impact of firm decisions (e.g. merger of two airline companies), to set pricing strategies (e.g. road pricing, toll definition, revenue management), to prioritize research and development decisions (e.g. ultra low emission vehicles) as well as to perform cost-benefit analyses of transportation projects (e.g. building a new bridge).","Prerequisite: CEE 3040, MATH 2940.",Spring.,CEE 6640,,,,,,,
968,CEE,6725,3D Printing Parts that Don't Break: From Processing to Performance,Derek Warner,09:40AM,10:55AM,To Be Assigned,"Novel additive manufacturing techniques are appealing in that they offer (1) improved design flexibility, (2) the capability to produce multifunctional components, and (3) an economical route for low volume production runs with less material waste. To utilize additive manufacturing (AM) technology for load bearing applications, one must have a sound understanding of the mechanical performance of components produced with AM methods. Relative to traditional manufacturing techniques, the mechanical performance of AM components is difficult to predict in that it depends not only on the processing route and parameters, but also on the component geometry. This course is aimed at giving students a knowledgebase to understand the connection between various AM processing techniques and the mechanical performance of AM metallic components. By focusing on the fundamental physical processes and features that govern the process-structure-performance relationships, the course is relevant to those interested in understanding the origins of mechanical behavior in metallic components regardless of fabrication process.","Prerequisite: CEE 4725 and MAE 4700, or equivalents.",Spring.,CEE 6725,,,,,,,

Animals occupied different functions and roles for humans, such as foe or protector and companion, food and resource, sacrificial victim, subject and object of prodigies, but also status symbol, pet, object of entertainment, of scientific study etc. At the same time, many animals had a divine side to them. We will look at how the different forms of interaction between humans and animals resulted from man's views of other species and how the interactions themselves helped shape these views.

We will read a short story and novels as well as some moral and political philosophy (Margaret Cavendish, Hobbes, Defoe, Cleland, Rousseau, Sterne, Laclos, Wollstonecraft, and Nietzsche) to address such topics as the ""marriage contract"" and the gender politics and economics of the family; love and benevolence in relation to law and obligation; medical discourse in relation to sexual ""criminality""; pornography as materialist science and sentimental-sexual education; suffering and the ethics and politics of pity.

Although many twentieth century analysts used psychoanalytic language to justify a hierarchy of races and civilizations, just as many did the opposite. Analyzing these anticolonial appropriations of Freudian psychoanalysis brings into focus unexpected connections in twentieth century radical politics.

A democratic and socially just society should enable all of its citizens to develop their potential to the full and to have the capacity, individually and collectively, to meet the challenge of change. Through learning, people can come to make a real contribution to their own communities and participate in local and national democratic processes. Two of the most ubiquitous formats of adult learning are 1) the workshop, and 2) one-on-one mentoring. As a backwards design approach and interactive facilitation principles can serve each application well, we will learn and practice both! In this course you will a) design and facilitate workshops, and b) mentor a Cornell employee as they pursues a learning goal, and do both by learning and applying design process and facilitation arts.

In addition to the more than two million people imprisoned under the criminal justice system, the U.S. government captures even more people into carceral spaces within and beyond its borders. Looking into a range of texts from Indigenous, Black, Latinx, Asian American, and Arab American writers, this course examines the U.S. penal system, not only as prisons and physical places, but also in state practices that decide social value, disadvantage people based on race, and criminalize them accordingly. Ultimately, this course asks and answers the following questions: what is the relationship between race and punishment? What are the socially constructed roles of incarceration? And what are some of the narratives and abolitionist, decolonial perspectives that push against them?",,Spring.,ENGL 2909,,,,,,,

The course focuses on narrative and figurative moments in theoretical texts as well as crucial literary sources (novels, novellas, and plays) as they collectively develop the modern economic paradigms of industry, exchange, credit-debt, and interest.

We will consider how the priority accorded the passion of self-preservation or life, the body, and the sexual and acquisitive drives subverted traditional ethics and was countervailed by compassion, sympathy, and other sentiments. We will read a short story and novels as well as some moral and political philosophy (Margaret Cavendish, Hobbes, Defoe, Cleland, Rousseau, Sterne, Laclos, Wollstonecraft, and Nietzsche) to address such topics as the ""marriage contract"" and the gender politics and economics of the family; love and benevolence in relation to law and obligation; medical discourse in relation to sexual ""criminality""; pornography as materialist science and sentimental-sexual education; suffering and the ethics and politics of pity.

Johnson, Jacob Lawrence, Archibald Motley, and Palmer Hayden, and musicians such as Duke Ellington and Bessie Smith.  We will read selected writings on Harlem from Malcolm X, Ralph Ellison and Chester Himes, and study the recent fictions by Mat Johnson, Colson Whitehead, Sapphire, Karla FC Holloway and A'Lelia Bundles.  We will draw on a range of media and technology, including resources based at the Library of Congress such as ""Drop Me Off in Harlem"" and ""Guide to Harlem Renaissance Materials,"" along with contemporary photographic projects such as Gayatri Spivak and Alice Attie's Harlem and Harlem:  A Century in Images by Deborah Willis and several co-authors.  ",,Spring.,ENGL 4508,,,,,,,

Political theology articulates the link between faith and reason in an attempt to ground political community in a language of legitimacy. First articulated in classical antiquity by Marcus Varro in Rome and later by Augustine, political theology is a way of naming and understanding the complex problem of authority. As distinct from religion, political theology is an (ongoing) social, political and cultural discourse of power over people's real lives. Whether (in modern terms) that governmental power has to do with abortion or gay marriage, political theological arguments always need to harness and synthesize these two sources.

Scripture modeled for them the concept of divinely sanctioned colonization. It also portended for them the precarity of such an elite status, challenged in their day by Viking attacks, corruption in the Church, and various ecological disasters. Such conflicting ideas about their place in the world generated sophisticated reflections about difference with respect to what is now called ""race,"" ""nationality,"" ""indigeneity,"" and the status of ""the human"" in the world.

In the name of the Women's liberation movement since the early 1900s, do Chinese women eventually hold up the half sky? From the cradle to the grave, what was most challenging in women's life? How did political, economic, and cultural forces frame women's professional careers and private life? No judgments nor imaginations. Using multi-media, such as Chinese independent documentary films, music, and photographs, students will discover the hidden stories behind the mainstream narratives.

Through a close examination of ethnographies, intellectual histories, and religious treatises, we will analyze the key debates and discourses surrounding the intersection of gender and Islam. We begin by investigating Quranic revelations and hadith concerning gender and sexual ethics, female figures of emulation in early Islam, and feminist exegeses of the Quran. Continuing onward, we focus upon the everyday lives of Muslim women and non-binary individuals in medieval, colonial, and post-colonial contexts, highlighting the ways in which people negotiate and respond to the sexual politics of the times in which they live as we ask what, if anything, is specifically ""Islamic"" about the situations under discussion? Following this, we embark upon a history of sexuality within Islam, tracing the ways in which the categories of ""homosexuality"" and ""heterosexuality"" came to exist in the Muslim world, as well as the history and positionality of trans communities past and present. We then continue with an exploration of Islamic feminism as it exists today, looking to the ways in which Muslim feminists have critically engaged both religious texts as well as Western feminist theory.

1832,FGSS,2932,Engendering China,Yue Du,09:40AM,10:55AM,To Be Assigned,"In contemporary China, as in many other places of the world, the ideology and social reality of gender relations is highly paradoxical. Women are flattered for their power as consumers and commitment to the family while they are also expected to engage in wage-earning employment. Men, on the other hand, face constant pressure of being tough and social problems such as costly betrothal gifts as unintended consequences of a gender regime that is supposedly male-oriented. Are these paradoxes a betrayal of the socialist experiment of erasing gender differences? Are they remnants of China's long imperial tradition? This course explores the power dynamics of gender relations in China from ancient times to the present. It leads students to examine scholarship that challenges the popularly accepted myth of lineal progression of China toward gender equality, and to understand women's and men's life choices in various historical settings. At the same time, this course guides students to adopt ""gender"" as a useful analytical category, treating China as a case study through which students are trained to ""engender"" any society past and present.",,Spring.,FGSS 2932,,,,,,,

In this course, we will delve into the neuroscience of gender difference. Reading the original scientific papers and related critical texts, we will ask whether we can find measurable physical differences in male and female brains, and what these differences might be. Do men and women solve spatial puzzles differently, as measured physiologically? Do nonhuman animals display sex-specific behaviors mediated by brain structure, and can we extrapolate these findings to human behavior? Why are boys three times more likely than girls to be diagnosed as autistic, and is there any connection between the predominantly male phenomenon of autism and other stereotypically male mental traits?

Thus we will give necessary attention to the disability experience as it overlaps and connects with lived experiences of race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and citizenship, among others. In looking particularly at the realms of employment, education, the law, and health care, we will explore the efficacy of legal and policy initiatives that are already in place, and in doing so, strongly consider the growing need for, and value of, intersectional approaches to discrimination and oppression.                                                       ",,Spring.,FGSS 4035,,,,,,,

Yet, for many, the design and facilitation of meaningful learning experiences can be as mysterious as an unopened black box. How does one go about creating inclusive educational experiences for diverse learners in our increasingly interconnected context? In this course we open the box to become better leaders of learning and action. A democratic and socially just society should enable all of its citizens to develop their potential to the full and to have the capacity, individually and collectively, to meet the challenge of change. Through learning, people can come to make a real contribution to their own communities and participate in local and national democratic processes. Two of the most ubiquitous formats of adult learning are 1) the workshop, and 2) one-on-one mentoring.

Through engagement with literary, musical, and scholarly texts (ability to read music not required, though previous musical experience is recommended), this seminar explores the interaction between music and text in compositions by Schubert, Berlioz, Liszt, and Mahler, asking: what happens when literature becomes song, opera, or symphony, and crucially, what is at stake in the process of transformation?

This seminar will analyze the interactions between academically sanctioned disciplines (such as iconography and connoisseurship) and innovations coming from philosophy, psychoanalysis, historiography, sociology, literary theory, mass media criticism, feminism, and Marxism. We will try especially to develop: (1) a general theory of ""visual ideology"" (the gender, social, racial, and class determinations on the production, consumption, and appropriation of visual artifacts under modern and postmodern conditions); and (2) contemporary theoretical practices that articulate these determinations. Examples will be drawn from the history of oil painting, architecture, city planning, photography, film, and other mass media.",,Spring.,GERST 6600,,,,,,,

2017,GOVT,4503,Becoming a China Hand,Jessica Weiss,02:40PM,05:10PM,To Be Assigned,"China's prominence in the news cycle and policy discourse reflects the immense and growing tension in China's relations with the United States and other countries around the world. Substantively, there is hardly a profession or sector where what happens inside China does not touch upon or impact what happens outside China. Throughout this course, we will grapple with ongoing debates over China's rise and whether policies of engagement with China have succeeded or failed. These debates are unfolding in many different communities and idea marketplaces, across many different modes and styles of analysis and writing. Each of the reading and writing assignments are aimed at developing literacy and proficiency in three different modes of analysis and writing about China: academic, policy, and journalistic. While many courses provide introductions to different aspects of China, and many seminars examine more specialized questions at even deeper levels, there are few that directly invite students to examine and explore the different ways in which scholars and professionals have written about and come to understand China.",,Spring.,GOVT 4503,,,,,,,

""Every philosopher has two philosophies, his own and Spinoza's"" (Bergson); and ""the savage anomaly"" (Negri) exerted profound influence on Marx, Nietzsche, Freud. We will introduce Spinoza and his legacy, from the ""atheism controversy"" in the eighteenth century to today's ""New Spinozists,"" who have been developing anti-Kantian and anti-Hegelian formulations of burning contemporary questions. With Spinoza, we ask: ""What is freedom, and whose power does it serve?"" (Leo Strauss)-especially if ""The new world system, the ultimate third stage of capitalism is for us the absent totality, Spinoza's God or Nature, the ultimate (indeed perhaps the only) referent, the true ground of Being in our time"" (Jameson).",,Spring.,GOVT 4769,,,,,,,

We derive the Ordinary Least Squares estimator and its characteristics using matrix algebra and determine the conditions under which it achieves statistical optimality. We then consider the circumstances in social scientific contexts which commonly lead to assumption violations, and the detection and implications of these problems. This leads to modified regression estimators that can offer limited forms of robustness in some of these cases. Finally, we briefly introduce likelihood-based techniques that incorporate assumptions about the distribution of the response variable, focusing on logistic regression for binary dependent variables. Students are expected to produce a research paper built around a quantitative analysis that is suitable for presentation at a professional conference.

Who are the key actors and decision makers who shape the laws and regulations that impact us at the local, state and federal levels of government? Most importantly, how do private individuals (lobbyists, trade associations, media and other influencers) sway how laws, rules and regulations impact our daily lives? The goal of this course is to provide a foundation of how private influence impacts our public policy. Building upon this foundation, students will learn who the key policymakers are in the public sector alongside of those in the private sector who seek to influence them.

A range of remedies – in areas as diverse as employment, education, health care, retirement, disability, housing, and parental leave – are available, yet different countries pursue alternative approaches to these issues. This seminar examines how politics shapes a government's social policy strategies. We will review the classic theories of welfare state variation emerging from Western Europe, how they shed light on the American approach to social policy, and to what extent they apply outside affluent democracies. We also will consider whether existing social policies can adapt to emerging issues, such as those posed by the gig economy and climate change.",,Spring.,GOVT 6223,,,,,,,

This seminar considers the phenomenal proliferation of regional organizations as well as subsequent developments in world politics which have contributed to their relative decline.

This class brings together political theory, intellectual history, and psychoanalysis to survey some of the ways Freud's concepts were taken up by radicals, artists, and writers critiquing the global colonial order. Although many twentieth century analysts used psychoanalytic language to justify a hierarchy of races and civilizations, just as many did the opposite. Analyzing these anticolonial appropriations of Freudian psychoanalysis brings into focus unexpected connections in twentieth century radical politics. Students can expect to discuss figures like Sigmund Freud, André Breton, Wifredo Lam, Aimé Césaire, Suzanne Césaire, Michel Leiris, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Albert Memmi, and Frantz Fanon. For longer description and instructor bio visit the Society for the Humanities website.",,Spring.,GOVT 6575,,,,,,,

Along with more coffee-houses, newspapers, operas, abandoned children, fashion choices, immigrants, slaves, diseases, debtors' prisons and crime came a sense of utopian possibility and a fear of social dissolution. What was the experience of rapid social change like, what solutions were proposed to meet a perceived crisis, and what do our present-day ideas about the threats and possibilities of large, diverse cities owe to the 18th century?

In the first part of the course, we will examine fascist ideology; its relation to democracy and dictatorship; whether fascism is best understood as another form of authoritarianism or as totalitarianism; the role of nationalism, race, religion, culture, gender, the family, and intellectuals in fascist regimes; and the institutional and economic foundations of fascist politics. The second half of the course covers the origins, development and defeat of fascist states in the mid-twentieth century.

Emphasis is placed on the philosophies of black nationalism, Pan Africanism and anticolonialism and the themes of emigration, expatriation, repatriation and exile. Awareness of Africa and attitudes toward the continent and its peoples have profoundly shaped African-American identity, culture and political consciousness. Notions of a linked fate between Africans and black Americans have long influenced black life and liberation struggles within the U.S. The motives, purposes and outlooks of African-American theorists who have claimed political, cultural, or spiritual connection to Africa and Africans have varied widely, though they have always powerfully reflected black experiences in America and in the West. The complexity and dynamism of those views belie simplistic assumptions about essential or ""natural"" relationships, and invite critical contemplation of the myriad roles that Africa has played in the African-American mind.""",,Spring.,HIST 2354,,,,,,,

Environmental history is a quickly evolving field, taking on increasing importance as the environment itself becomes increasingly important in world affairs. During this semester, we'll examine the sometimes unexpected ways in which ""natural"" forces have shaped human history (the role of germs, for instance, in the colonization of North America); the ways in which human beings have shaped the natural world (through agriculture, urbanization, and industrialization, as well as the formation of things like wildlife preserves); and the ways in which cultural, scientific, political, and philosophical attitudes toward the environment have changed over time. This is designed as an intensely interdisciplinary course: we'll view history through the lenses of ecology, literature, art, film, law, anthropology, and geography. Our focus will be on the United States, but, just as environmental pollutants cross borders, so too will this class, especially toward the end, when we attempt to put U.S. environmental history into a geopolitical context.

2246,HIST,2932,Engendering China,Yue Du,09:40AM,10:55AM,To Be Assigned,"In contemporary China, as in many other places of the world, the ideology and social reality of gender relations is highly paradoxical. Women are flattered for their power as consumers and commitment to the family while they are also expected to engage in wage-earning employment. Men, on the other hand, face constant pressure of being tough and social problems such as costly betrothal gifts as unintended consequences of a gender regime that is supposedly male-oriented. Are these paradoxes a betrayal of the socialist experiment of erasing gender differences? Are they remnants of China's long imperial tradition? This course explores the power dynamics of gender relations in China from ancient times to the present. It leads students to examine scholarship that challenges the popularly accepted myth of lineal progression of China toward gender equality, and to understand women's and men's life choices in various historical settings. At the same time, this course guides students to adopt ""gender"" as a useful analytical category, treating China as a case study through which students are trained to ""engender"" any society past and present.",,Spring.,HIST 2932,,,,,,,

The course will define the region broadly, to include the lands stretching from today's Ukraine to Poland and the Balkans. But given the constant flux in borders, demographics, and sovereignities of this region, we will have to continually reconsider what and where Eastern Europe was.

We'll consider as many kinds of history writing as possible, including some that are more traditional and some that are more experimental. To get at the complexity of the problem, we'll approach it from at least three distinct angles, examining the actual history of the writing of history (going back to Herodotus, ""The Father of Lies""); the theory and philosophy of the writing of history; and current writing practices. Readings will range widely through time and space and will be assessed not just for the quality of their arguments or their place in a given historiography but also for their success as pieces of writing. We'll discuss such topics as narrative structure, the role of the first person, tone, character development, and the basic use of language. Students will also be expected to do a fair amount of writing for this class and to share their papers in a workshop setting-though no new research will be required during the semester. Obviously, the course is geared toward students in the History department, but anyone doing historical writing in any discipline whatsoever-English, Science and Technology Studies, Sociology, etc.-is warmly invited to sign up.",,Spring.,HIST 6350,,,,,,,

The colonial worldview in which only Western(ized) experiences could be modern is foundational to the multifarious ways in which scholarship and nation-builders have engaged with progress, whether aspiring to it, rejecting it, or appropriating it. In this seminar we explore how imperial authorities, nationalists, and scholars/intellectuals have interfaced with idea(l)s of progress and modernity in Asia, reading works (""one book a week"") grounded in multiple disciplines and cultural settings. Core themes will include: health and hygiene, consumption, technology, gender, piety and devotion, imperialism and race, and nationalism.",Prerequisite: one 3000 level course in the humanities; some knowledge of Asian history.,Spring.,HIST 6408,,,,,,,

That global reach is not new, and goes back all the way to 1898 and the Spanish-American War. This course will look at the American military experience from our first tentative steps onto the global stage in 1898, to the earth-spanning conflicts of World War I and II, to the nuclear tension of Cold War conflicts, and finish with the current Long War against terrorism, and the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.",,"Fall, Spring, Summer.",HIST 6571,,,,,,,

2361,ILROB,4795,Managerial Negotiations,Alice Lee,07:30PM,10:00PM,To Be Assigned,"This course aims to help students improve their skills in two fundamental ways. One is knowledge-oriented: students learn frameworks and concepts for analyzing conflict. Students acquire terms and models for identifying the type of conflict that exists in a situation and the potential costs and benefits of different strategies and tactics. Based on this, students should be able to interpret situations, plan tactics, and recognize and react to their counterpart's behavior. A second and complementary route to improving as a negotiator is practice-oriented: students complement their analytical tools with behavioral skills. Negotiation and conflict ultimately come down to behaviors—how a manager opens a potentially volatile conversation, how a mediator uncovers information, how a negotiator frames an offer or a concession. Practicing these behaviors, and understanding how other parties perceive and react to them, is essential to improving as a negotiator. The course provides continuing opportunities for hands-on practice and also provides feedback, discussion, and occasions for reflection. 
                
Through role-play exercises, lecture, reading, and discussion, the course begins with basic dynamics in negotiation and adds complexity in stages, including multiple issues, multiple parties, mediation, agents, and coalitions. Some exercises involve numerical analyses, others revolve around qualitative conflicts. By the end of the course, students should be able to comfortably and confidently approach most any conflict or negotiation: analyzing its nature, understanding their own objectives, and plotting an approach that will give them the best shot at achieving their goals.

Although today many might think of Islamophobia or Judeophobia as unchangeable---fear of and hatred for Islam and Muslims or Judaism and Jews---these ideas and the social and political practices informed by them have varied greatly over time and place. They even intersected during the Middle Age and in Ottoman times when ""the Jew"" was frequently represented as allied with ""The Muslim"". The first part of this course traces the history, trajectory, and political agency of Judeophobia and Islamophobia in texts and other forms of culture from late antiquity through the present. The second part of the course is devoted to modernity and the present especially in Europe and the United States focusing on representational practices---how Muslims/Islam and Jews/Judaism are portrayed in various discourses including the media, film and on the internet.

As such, the course offers students a tour of different ancient civilizations and corpora. Students read selections from cuneiform Akkadian tablets, Egyptian Christian Coptic spellbooks, rabbinic sources such as the Talmud, among many other works. At the same time, students will be required to critically engage recent scholarship in the history of science and medicine as a way to help frame their analyses of the ancient materials.

Themes covered include creation, Sabbath, prayer, Jerusalem, pious customs, magic, reincarnation, revelation, among others. Throughout the semester students perform close readings of a wide selection of Jewish texts from the Bible, Talmud, kabbalah (mysticism), philosophy, liturgy, and modern Jewish thought. In what ways are these various traditions of Judaism interrelated and/or in tension with one another? In the face of the Jewish history's tremendous diversity, what is it that has unified Judaism and the Jewish people over the centuries? By exploring these types of questions, this course examines the appropriateness of defining Judaism as a religion, an ethnicity, a civilization, and/or a culture.

Does it have to feature characters identifiable as Jews? If artists who identify as Jews—actors, directors, screenwriters, composers—play significant roles in a film's production does that make it Jewish? Our primary point of entry into these questions will be Hollywood, from the industry's early silent films, through the period generally considered classical, down to the present day. We will also study films produced overseas, in countries that may include Israel, Egypt, France, Italy, and Germany. Our discussions will be enriched by contextual material drawn from film studies, cultural studies, Jewish studies, American studies, and other related fields. Students will be expected to view a significant number of films outside of class—an average of one per week—and engage with them through writing and in-class discussion. The directors, screenwriters, composers, and actors whose work we will study may include: Charlie Chaplin, Irving Berlin, Al Jolson, Fanny Brice, Billy Wilder, Barbra Streisand, Woody Allen, Mel Brooks, Aviva Kempner, Joan Micklin Silver, the Marx Brothers, and the Coen Brothers.",,Spring.,JWST 2790,,,,,,,

The course will define the region broadly, to include the lands stretching from today's Ukraine to Poland and the Balkans. But given the constant flux in borders, demographics, and sovereignities of this region, we will have to continually reconsider what and where Eastern Europe was. We will survey key periods in the region's history, looking closely at cases from across Eastern Europe.

We will read histories, memoirs, and fiction, and view films that help us better understand inter-communal relations, tensions, and conflict. We will also interrogate the terms for exploring a range distinctions among majority and minority populations including: religious difference (Muslims, Christians, and Jews); divisions of religious rite (Sunni and Shi'a); entho-linguistic minorities (Armenians and Kurds); national identities (Israelis and Palestinians); cultures of origin (Mizrahi, Sephardi, and Ashkenazi Jews).

The involvement of Latin American artists with modern media technologies dates at least to the late nineteenth century and has especially flourished in the last three decades. The canonical histories and criticism of Latin American art for the most part depict a history of artistic production in which technology plays a minor or invisible role. This construction of history reinforces the assumption that experimentation, innovation, and theorization in technological art are exclusive provinces of the developed world. As the history of art expands to include diverse areas of media arts and visual culture, the recognition of Latin American artists' involvement with technology is not only overdue but also essential to the development of more diverse and rigorous understandings of both modernity and modernism.",,Spring.,LATA 4155,,,,,,,

The involvement of Latin American artists with modern media technologies dates at least to the late nineteenth century and has especially flourished in the last three decades. The canonical histories and criticism of Latin American art for the most part depict a history of artistic production in which technology plays a minor or invisible role. This construction of history reinforces the assumption that experimentation, innovation, and theorization in technological art are exclusive provinces of the developed world. As the history of art expands to include diverse areas of media arts and visual culture, the recognition of Latin American artists' involvement with technology is not only overdue but also essential to the development of more diverse and rigorous understandings of both modernity and modernism.",,Spring.,LATA 6155,,,,,,,

Examples from across the globe show how the ""arc of disaster"" makes human rights violations both predictable and preventable. Key elements of the US domestic emergency response framework are covered in depth, with attention to areas that conflict with international human rights norms and obligations. The international disaster response framework is also examined. We also examine the US response to international disasters, including policy towards foreign nationals in the US when disaster strikes abroad. Finally, we consider questions of accountability for government actors and international organizations for human rights harms following a disaster. What the course does not do: This is not a survey course in international human rights. We will not cover the entire range of international instruments and mechanisms that potentially come into play within the context of disaster. They are endless. Rather, I include cases that I have personally worked on (Hurricane Katrina, the 2010 earthquake in Haiti), those that stand as turning points in the development of disaster law and policy (Typhoon Haiyan), and others that reflect common themes.

Continuing onward, we focus upon the everyday lives of Muslim women and non-binary individuals in medieval, colonial, and post-colonial contexts, highlighting the ways in which people negotiate and respond to the sexual politics of the times in which they live as we ask what, if anything, is specifically ""Islamic"" about the situations under discussion? Following this, we embark upon a history of sexuality within Islam, tracing the ways in which the categories of ""homosexuality"" and ""heterosexuality"" came to exist in the Muslim world, as well as the history and positionality of trans communities past and present. We then continue with an exploration of Islamic feminism as it exists today, looking to the ways in which Muslim feminists have critically engaged both religious texts as well as Western feminist theory.

This course uses the organ to explore music's relation to technology, history and culture, and in turn traces the technical and mechanical mysteries, and expressive possibilities, of the 'King of Instruments' across its long history. Students will gain 1) an understanding of some key aspects of musical history and repertoire; 2) a sense for the historical relation between music and technology; 3) a new knowledge of (and enthusiasm for!) the organ; and 4) an insight into the ways in which musical instruments and the musical practice associated with them are cross-cultural and interdisciplinary. With a key focus on the music of J. S. Bach, as well as on the reception of Bach's music in the 19th and 20th centuries, topics include the mechanics of organ construction, the North German organ art and the toccata, virtuosity and the use of the feet, the symphonic organ in the 19th century, 20th-century experimentation with organ sound, the organ and film. The course combines lectures with practical studio-style sessions at Cornell's four superb organs, and unprecedented access to those instruments.

(Just think—no more required readings, no more memorization, no more Saturday nights spent studying for prelims!) For one student, the title character of Goethe's 1806 drama Faust, no price is too high: when the devil offers him erudition beyond belief, Faust signs away his soul without a second thought. This cautionary tale of scholarly folly captured the musical imagination of the nineteenth century, giving rise to myriad musical adaptations of the Faust legend. Through engagement with literary, musical, and scholarly texts (ability to read music not required, though previous musical experience is recommended), this seminar explores the interaction between music and text in compositions by Schubert, Berlioz, Liszt, and Mahler, asking: what happens when literature becomes song, opera, or symphony, and crucially, what is at stake in the process of transformation?

Unless companies have sufficient access to financial resources, they are unable to grow, become more productive and create new jobs. Entrepreneurial startups face particularly important challenges. In the early phases of their life cycle, few, if any, young firms have enough tangible assets that they can pledge as collateral. As a result, these companies usually find it difficult to borrow from banks. While this is true in advanced economies, this challenge is often unsurmountable in emerging economies. At the same time, however, startups tend to be particularly innovative. Without transformational entrepreneurs who have access to sufficient funding, it is difficult for emerging economies to foster technological change and productivity growth through a process of creative destruction.

Marketing is changing because we have much more data, new ways to store and deploy the data, new machine learning capabilities, more social forms of media, shifts in how retailing is done, new platform business models, and, resisting these trends, a growing consumer concern for privacy. This course examines several topics in data-intensive marketing, such as direct-to-consumer marketing, digital advertising, and multi-sided platforms. We study the new institutions that support marketing, and that is important for several reasons. First, marketing managers need to decide who to partner with. They have to assemble a stack of marketing technology partners and suppliers. Second, the entrepreneurs who build these institutions need to know how they fit together into an ecosystem, how they collaborate and how they compete. Third there is a tension between the tech giants, Google, Amazon, and Facebook, that offer themselves as fully integrated systems for the practice of data-driven marketing, and the rest of the institutional space, which contains large specialized firms and smaller niche specialists that must be integrated by the marketing clients. Marketers and investors should have a point of view on whether, or to what extent, the future lies with the giants, or the more open system of data flows among the niches.  In sum, the goal of the course is to introduce the marketing ecosystem within which students of today, both data scientists and managers, will make their careers.

They even intersected during the Middle Age and in Ottoman times when ""the Jew"" was frequently represented as allied with ""The Muslim"". The first part of this course traces the history, trajectory, and political agency of Judeophobia and Islamophobia in texts and other forms of culture from late antiquity through the present. The second part of the course is devoted to modernity and the present especially in Europe and the United States focusing on representational practices---how Muslims/Islam and Jews/Judaism are portrayed in various discourses including the media, film and on the internet.

Firms provide a structure through which people can organize themselves into those groups or teams. They are categorized by the nature of the property rights owners hold in the firm, and by the details of the firm's contractual arrangements. Common firm types include partnerships, sole proprietorships, non-profits, mutuals, and publicly traded corporations, among others. This course focuses on one important firm type: the modern publicly traded, privately owned corporation. The course uses economic and statistical analysis to study the interaction of the public corporation, the market, and the law, and how those interactions affect the welfare of managers, shareholders and consumers. The costs and benefits of that standard corporate form of organization are examined. A variety of legal institutions, some of which have evolved over decades, are analyzed. Those institutions define and govern the corporation. They include limited liability, fiduciary duties, the business judgment rule, and shareholder voting. The mechanisms of corporate governance, i.e., those legal and market-based forces that help control the corporation and ensure that managers operate it in shareholders' interest, are examined. Corporate governance mechanisms include hostile takeovers, insider trading, outside directors on the board, the monitoring role of institutional investors, audits, and executive compensation plans. State corporate law and anti-takeover devices are also discussed. The role and impact of federal policies, such as the 1933-34 Exchange Acts, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act in affecting corporate structure and managerial behavior will be an important focus.

How does that determine the kinds of sounds we find pleasant and not so pleasant? How is sound generated by strings, pipes, and plates, and what determines the characteristics – pitch, timbre, attack, consonance, or dissonance – of that sound? How do the major families of musical instruments (string, wind, reed, brass, percussion) and specific examples (violin, guitar, piano, flute, oboe, trumpet, chimes, pipe organ) work, and how does that affect how they are played and the sounds they produce? How do we generate sound when we sing, and how does that vary in different kinds of singing? What makes for a good concert hall or listening space? These are explained using physical and mathematical concepts including vibrations, standing waves, harmonic series, beats, spectra, and logarithms, and illustrated using demonstrations, audio clips, and musical selections from a wide variety of genres.

Through a close examination of ethnographies, intellectual histories, and religious treatises, we will analyze the key debates and discourses surrounding the intersection of gender and Islam. We begin by investigating Quranic revelations and hadith concerning gender and sexual ethics, female figures of emulation in early Islam, and feminist exegeses of the Quran. Continuing onward, we focus upon the everyday lives of Muslim women and non-binary individuals in medieval, colonial, and post-colonial contexts, highlighting the ways in which people negotiate and respond to the sexual politics of the times in which they live as we ask what, if anything, is specifically ""Islamic"" about the situations under discussion? Following this, we embark upon a history of sexuality within Islam, tracing the ways in which the categories of ""homosexuality"" and ""heterosexuality"" came to exist in the Muslim world, as well as the history and positionality of trans communities past and present. We then continue with an exploration of Islamic feminism as it exists today, looking to the ways in which Muslim feminists have critically engaged both religious texts as well as Western feminist theory.

A man rejects vehemently the very idea of the Devil's existence, unwittingly doing so right in his face. From outright horrifying to eerily funny, always dangerous, but at times benevolent, demons, witches, and other mysterious and elusive creatures of Russian lore inhabit people's imagination and figure prominently in a number of Russian books and films.

We will examine traditional themes in the teaching of U.S. history—territorial expansion and empire, migration and nation building, industrialization and labor, war and revolution, and citizenship and transnationalism—but we will examine this ""American experience"" in a broader hemispheric context and include as actors americanos of Spanish, Mexican, Caribbean, and Central/South American ancestries.",,Spring.,SHUM 1802,,,,,,,

Through case studies of familial and conjugal love in Africa, Asia, the US, Europe, and South and Latin America, the course will examine the debates about and enactment's of what constitutes the appropriate way to show love and affection in different cultures and historical contexts. Among the themes we will explore are questions of sexuality, marriage, kinship, and gender rights. A final unit will examine these themes through modern technologies such as the Internet, scientific advances in medicine, and a growing awareness that who and how we love is anything but simple or universal.",,Spring.,SHUM 1930,,,,,,,

In addition to the more than two million people imprisoned under the criminal justice system, the U.S. government captures even more people into carceral spaces within and beyond its borders. Looking into a range of texts from Indigenous, Black, Latinx, Asian American, and Arab American writers, this course examines the U.S. penal system, not only as prisons and physical places, but also in state practices that decide social value, disadvantage people based on race, and criminalize them accordingly. Ultimately, this course asks and answers the following questions: what is the relationship between race and punishment? What are the socially constructed roles of incarceration? And what are some of the narratives and abolitionist, decolonial perspectives that push against them?",,Spring.,SHUM 2009,,,,,,,
4049,SHUM,2244,"The Music, Art, and Technology of the Organ",Annette Richards,12:25PM,01:15PM,To Be Assigned,"The organ is an interdisciplinary wonder where mechanics, architecture, acoustics, religion, philosophy, literature, as well as the musical arts and sciences meet. This course uses the organ to explore music's relation to technology, history and culture, and in turn traces the technical and mechanical mysteries, and expressive possibilities, of the 'King of Instruments' across its long history. Students will gain 1) an understanding of some key aspects of musical history and repertoire; 2) a sense for the historical relation between music and technology; 3) a new knowledge of (and enthusiasm for!) the organ; and 4) an insight into the ways in which musical instruments and the musical practice associated with them are cross-cultural and interdisciplinary. With a key focus on the music of J. S. Bach, as well as on the reception of Bach's music in the 19th and 20th centuries, topics include the mechanics of organ construction, the North German organ art and the toccata, virtuosity and the use of the feet, the symphonic organ in the 19th century, 20th-century experimentation with organ sound, the organ and film. The course combines lectures with practical studio-style sessions at Cornell's four superb organs, and unprecedented access to those instruments. No prior musical experience necessary, although those interested (and with some keyboard skills) will have the opportunity to learn to play – with both hands and feet.",,Spring.,SHUM 2244,,,,,,,

Can a poem or a novel palliate pain, illness, even the possibility of death? From darkly comic narratives of black plague to the rise and fall of hysteria to depictions of the AIDS crisis, this course examines literature centered on medical practices from the early modern period through the twentieth century. Why have medical practices changed, and how do writers address their political, social, and ideological implications? Readings will include a broad range of genres, including poetry (Dickinson, Whitman, Keats), fiction (McEwan, Chekhov, Gilman, Kafka, Camus), theater (Kushner), nonfiction prose (Woolf, Freud), and critical theory (Foucault, Scarry, Canguilhem, Sontag).",,Spring.,SHUM 2350,,,,,,,

In this course, we will explore a wide range of Japanese pop cultural forms, exploring the interactions between different media, Japanese pop culture as global pop culture, and a variety of modes of analyzing visual and audio materials. We will also see how pop cultural works themselves, in their content and form, engage with questions of gender, technology, fandom, nation, and the environment.

4052,SHUM,2482,Anthropology of Climate Change,Chloe Ahmann,11:25AM,12:40PM,To Be Assigned,"What does it mean to study humanity at a time when it has become a geological force? What is required of us as thinking subjects under the Anthropocene? In this course, we will argue that anthropologists have an important role to play at this historical juncture. But we will also consider how climate change troubles some of the discipline's central categories. Time, space, nature, power, reason – climate change throws these concepts into question. It inflects our ways of knowing. It demands adaptive thinking. Throughout the semester, we will take on this work in common, proceeding from the presumption that it is not enough to think of climate change as a simple ethnographic object. Climate change is the unavoidable context of contemporary anthropology.",,,SHUM 2482,,,,,,,
4053,SHUM,2701,Music and Digital Gameplay,Roger Moseley,01:30PM,02:20PM,To Be Assigned,"This course considers both music and digital games in light of their playability. It aims to provide students with critical frameworks for addressing the diverse roles played by music in digital games as well as the ways in which playing digital games can be considered a musical activity. Focusing on games across an array of genres from first-person shooters to rhythm-action titles, the course will introduce students to recent scholarship on digital games from multiple disciplinary angles. No formal musical training is necessary, but suitably qualified students may take the course as a 3000-level elective by signing up for MUSIC 3901 and completing additional research components involving the creation and/or analysis of specific soundtracks or performances.",,Spring.,SHUM 2701,,,,,,,

4059,SHUM,3010,Sweetness: How Sugar Built the Modern World,Gerard Aching,01:25PM,02:40PM,To Be Assigned,"When sugar ""was king,"" that is, when it was valued in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, as we might value petroleum today, European nations went to war in order to possess the sugar producing islands in the Caribbean. Sugar production, slave labor, and the transatlantic trade that they generated were crucial for European empire building and the creation of the enormous wealth that, in comparison with earlier historical periods, rapidly revolutionized agriculture, nutrition, industry, labor, and free trade; racialized Caribbean peoples; and gave rise to transatlantic debates on freedom, abolitionism, and humanitarian philanthropy. Readings include A. Stuart, Sugar in the Blood, S. Mintz, Sweetness and Power, C.L.R. James, Black Jacobins. Films include, Gutiérrez Alea's The Last Supper and M.

What affinities, loves and thefts, and tensions are present in cultural forms such as anime, jazz, kung fu, and K-pop? Students will consider the intersections and overlap between African and Asian diasporic cultures in global cities such as New York, Chicago, Havana, Lahore, Kingston, and Hong Kong to ask the question: when did Africa and Asia first encounter each other? This will be contextualized through a political and historical lens of the formation of a proto-Global South in the early twentieth, Afro-futurism, women of color feminisms, and Third World solidarity and internationalism. Tackling issues of race, gender, sexuality, and resistance, this seminar also reckons with the intertwined legacies of the institutions of African enslavement and Asian indenture by reading the novels of Patricia Powell and the paintings of Kehinde Wiley, for instance.

4062,SHUM,3325,Game Studies and Japan,Andrew Campana,02:45PM,04:00PM,To Be Assigned,"Video games have become one of the major cultural forces of the world, far surpassing the size of the film and music industries combined. They have also been key to developments in digital culture and technology, with the full extent of their impact on contemporary society only beginning to be understood. For much of the history of digital games, the vast majority of popular works have come from Japan—Nintendo, Sony, Sega, Capcom, Namco, and other companies have defined the medium as we know it—yet this remains largely not reflected in the growing discipline of game studies. In this course, we will explore key works from throughout game history and game studies in relation to culture and media in Japan, through experiments in writing, gameplay, and other forms of critical media practice.",,,SHUM 3325,,,,,,,
4063,SHUM,3475,Philosophy of Punishment,Benjamin Yost,02:45PM,04:00PM,To Be Assigned,"This course addresses central debates in the philosophy of legal punishment. We will analyze the leading theories of punishment, including the familiar retributivist and deterrent alternatives, as well as lesser-known hybrid, self-defense, and rehabilitative accounts. We will ask whether each theory offers a general justification for establishing institutions of punishment, and whether each theory justifies specific acts of punishment. Other topics may include criminal responsibility, the legitimacy of collateral consequences (e.g., the denial of felons' voting rights), alternatives to punishment, etc.",,Spring.,SHUM 3475,,,,,,,
4064,SHUM,3610,Fables of Capitalism,Paul Fleming,11:25AM,12:40PM,To Be Assigned,"This course examines the stories, literary examples, and metaphors at work in elaborating the modern economic subject, the so-called ""homo oeconomicus."" We will examine material from Locke, Smith, Defoe, and Mill through Marx, Nietzsche, Brecht, and Weber, up to current the neoliberal subject and its critiques (Foucault, Bataille). The course focuses on narrative and figurative moments in theoretical texts as well as crucial literary sources (novels, novellas, and plays) as they collectively develop the modern economic paradigms of industry, exchange, credit-debt, and interest. The course thus addresses both literary and theoretical sources, particularly the stories and examples told to justify the liberal order as well as its guiding metaphors such as the invisible hand; Schuld as both debt and guilt; investment (in oneself, in one's future); and the intersection of religious and secular economies.",,,SHUM 3610,,,,,,,

We begin by investigating the legacy of the Ottoman Empire and the impact of its dissolution. We will focus our attention on commercial centers that fostered inter-communal relations, as well as investigating sites of strife and cases of minority repression. We will read histories, memoirs, and fiction, and view films that help us better understand inter-communal relations, tensions, and conflict. We will also interrogate the terms for exploring a range distinctions among majority and minority populations including: religious difference (Muslims, Christians, and Jews); divisions of religious rite (Sunni and Shi'a); entho-linguistic minorities (Armenians and Kurds); national identities (Israelis and Palestinians); cultures of origin (Mizrahi, Sephardi, and Ashkenazi Jews).

Specifically we will look at how writers and political figures such as Maya Angelou, Chimamanda Adichie, Richard Wright, Eugene Robinson, Philippe Wamba, Martin Luther King Junior and Malcolm X have understood the meeting.",,Spring.,SHUM 3742,,,,,,,

We will study the work and impact of humanists (scholars of literature, history, theory, art, visual studies, film, anthropology, gender and sexuality studies), who pose big questions about the human condition. By reading and analyzing their scholarship—critiquing them and engaging their ideas—we will craft our own methods and voices. Students will refine their research methods (library research, note taking, organizing material, bibliographies, citation methods, proposals, outlines, etc.) and design their own independent research project.

Professors, doctors, countries, hotels, pollution, books, intelligence: there is hardly anything that is not subject to some form of review, rating, or ranking these days. This senior seminar examines the practices, cultures, and technologies of evaluation and asks how value is established, maintained, compared, subverted, resisted, and institutionalized in a range of different settings. Topics include user reviews, institutional audit, ranking and commensuration, algorithmic evaluation, tasting, gossip, and awards. Drawing on case studies from science, technology, culture, accounting, art, environment, and everyday life, we shall explore how evaluation comes to order our lives – and why it is so difficult to resist.",,,SHUM 4561,,,,,,,

We'll give special attention to speculation in African American literature to think through how Black people used art in the midst of anti-blackness to imagine worlds otherwise and for the pleasure of the craft. We'll read Black speculation through multiple forms, including novels, graphic novels, film, and music. Figures for consideration include William J. Wilson (""Ethiop""), Pauline Hopkins, Frances E.

Can there be social revolution without psychic liberation? This class brings together political theory, intellectual history, and psychoanalysis to survey some of the ways Freud's concepts were taken up by radicals, artists, and writers critiquing the global colonial order. Although many twentieth century analysts used psychoanalytic language to justify a hierarchy of races and civilizations, just as many did the opposite. Analyzing these anticolonial appropriations of Freudian psychoanalysis brings into focus unexpected connections in twentieth century radical politics. Students can expect to discuss figures like Sigmund Freud, André Breton, Wifredo Lam, Aimé Césaire, Suzanne Césaire, Michel Leiris, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Albert Memmi, and Frantz Fanon. For longer description and instructor bio visit the Society for the Humanities website.",,Spring.,SHUM 4677,,,,,,,

Reparations.,Carla Hung,02:40PM,04:35PM,To Be Assigned,"As renewed calls against racial violence in this country are articulated through the language of abolitionism, this course investigates how activism and projects to promote greater social justice are reorienting around an abolitionist worldview. Looking both backwards and forward, this course examines how the abolition of the Trans-Atlantic slave trade informs contemporary practices of advocating for racial justice. Over the course of the semester, we will turn to the work of social justice activists in order to interpret strategic planning documents by organizations working to promote transformative and reparative justice. For longer description and instructor bio visit the Society for the Humanities website.",,Spring.,SHUM 4678,,,,,,,

This class explores the generativity of broken worlds. It considers the question of brokenness through analyzing thwarted infrastructures across the globe that give rise to the impulse of repair of our everyday social, material, political, and affective lives. Broken infrastructures can, indeed, afford various reparative affects, practices and spaces. Yet, to repair means that not only humans, but also nonhumans, such as plants or animals, can emerge as infrastructures of repair in their own right. This class then emerges from the idea that we are restorative species, constantly engaged in mending and fixing of broken material and affective worlds. The course ends by reffllflecting on the reparative potential of researchers. For longer description and instructor bio visit the Society for the Humanities website.",,Spring.,SHUM 4679,,,,,,,
4073,SHUM,4680,Art and the Remapping of the World,Kelly Presutti,02:40PM,04:35PM,To Be Assigned,"What possibilities does art offer to challenge the primacy of mapping in visualizing our world? Maps allow us to move through space, but they do so by abstracting space to its barest aspects—an act of reduction that has historically served to eliminate Indigenous inhabitants, ecological entanglements, non-spatial elements, and countless other features of our lived environment. This course posits remapping as an act of repair, a means of correcting some of the reductive tendencies of maps. Moving between the history of cartography, particularly as it appears in Cornell's extensive Map Collection, and a study of artistic critiques of the map, we will develop a critical vocabulary for assessing cartographic practice and explore new tools for imagining it otherwise. For longer description and instructor bio visit the Society for the Humanities website.",,Spring.,SHUM 4680,,,,,,,

We will look at aesthetic productions from post-independence Algeria and Ghana, post-apartheid South Africa and post-genocide Rwanda, among others, in order to reflect on multiple questions, including: How do aesthetic works and state institutions offer competing narratives of a traumatic past, and what ways of healing can they generate? How do they negotiate between the retributive and the restorative impulses of justice? Is justice sufficient for resolution to take place? And conversely, can repair ever be achieved in the absence of justice? For longer description and instructor bio visit the Society for the Humanities website.",,Spring.,SHUM 4681,,,,,,,

Performances of the everyday, alongside films, texts, and performance art, will be analyzed through a performance studies methodological lens.  Through close readings and sustained cultural analysis, students will acquire a critical understanding of the potentiality of spaces, places, and geographies codified as ""after hours"" in the development of subcultures, alternative sexualities, and emerging performance practices.",,Spring.,SHUM 4701,,,,,,,

With the advent of Western and American colonialism and imperialism, coupled with recent successes in westernization by the Japanese, Chinese artists had to redefine their roles as well as their visions. This turmoil bore witness to a vibrant beginning in modern Chinese art. Interactions between the Chinese themselves, and Chinese interactions with foreigners in the major cities of Shanghai and Beijing, fostered new directions in Chinese art and helped shape western visions of Chinese art history. Issues covered include: Chinese debates on western influence--their theoretical foundations and rationales; New visions for the future of Chinese art in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; Pluralistic approaches and arguments on ""Chinese identity"" in the modern era; Collecting art and the vision of history; The identity of traditional literati painters in the modern era-their roles, artworks, and deeds; Foreigners in China-the formation of major European collections of Chinese art, and the formation of ""Chinese art history"" in the West.",,Spring.,SHUM 4916,,,,,,,

Can we conceptualize a literary settler colonialism? What is a settler text? And what are the literary aspects and politics that bind this genre? This course approaches this question comparatively, looking into the United States and Israel as active settler colonialisms, and analyzes American nationalism, Zionism (as a European nationalist movement), and their overlap in American Zionist writings. The course begins with critical scholarship in the fields of American Indian and Indigenous studies, settler colonial studies, and Palestine studies, then moves into literary texts, canonical and lesser known, that we will read and hypothesize as settler texts.",,Spring.,SHUM 6009,,,,,,,

This class explores the generativity of broken worlds. It considers the question of brokenness through analyzing thwarted infrastructures across the globe that give rise to the impulse of repair of our everyday social, material, political, and affective lives. Broken infrastructures can, indeed, afford various reparative affects, practices and spaces. Yet, to repair means that not only humans, but also nonhumans, such as plants or animals, can emerge as infrastructures of repair in their own right. This class then emerges from the idea that we are restorative species, constantly engaged in mending and fixing of broken material and affective worlds. The course ends by reffllflecting on the reparative potential of researchers. For longer description and instructor bio visit the Society for the Humanities website.",,Spring.,SHUM 6679,,,,,,,

Maps allow us to move through space, but they do so by abstracting space to its barest aspects—an act of reduction that has historically served to eliminate Indigenous inhabitants, ecological entanglements, non-spatial elements, and countless other features of our lived environment. This course posits remapping as an act of repair, a means of correcting some of the reductive tendencies of maps. Moving between the history of cartography, particularly as it appears in Cornell's extensive Map Collection, and a study of artistic critiques of the map, we will develop a critical vocabulary for assessing cartographic practice and explore new tools for imagining it otherwise. For longer description and instructor bio visit the Society for the Humanities website.",,Spring.,SHUM 6680,,,,,,,

We will look at aesthetic productions from post-independence Algeria and Ghana, post-apartheid South Africa and post-genocide Rwanda, among others, in order to reflect on multiple questions, including: How do aesthetic works and state institutions offer competing narratives of a traumatic past, and what ways of healing can they generate? How do they negotiate between the retributive and the restorative impulses of justice? Is justice sufficient for resolution to take place?

Course materials are designed to illustrate the distinctive features of the sociological perspective and to start you thinking sociologically about yourself and the broader social world. To think sociologically is to recognize that being embedded in the world constrains behavior, and that individuals are both social actors and social products. To think sociologically is also to recognize that our contemporary world, with its enduring cultural, political, and economic institutions, is as much a social product as we are. We will begin by covering theoretical and methodological foundations of the sociological perspective.  We will go on to explore the concept of social stratification and will survey primary axes of social difference. In the second half of the course we will look more closely at how individuals relate to each other, how social inequality is enacted and reinforced in everyday life, and at the way in which the organization of social life shapes individuals and groups, such as through social networks, residential neighborhoods, schooling, families, and on-line communication.",,"Fall, Spring, Summer.",SOC 1101,SOC 1101,Schnabel,A,FA21,282,,0.0

In this dynamic world, emerging technologies exist in a state of flux as a mixture of blueprint and hardware, plan and practice, the nearly on-line and the almost obsolete, surrounded by speculation and speculators, who make often-contested claims about their promises, perils, and possibilities. Among the characteristics of this space are:  the frequent appearance of unverifiable claims about technologies that have yet to materialize; an entrepreneurial drive for commercial implementation; ongoing institutional innovation; frequent public controversies; and problems of political legitimacy. The course will examine the epistemic, discursive, institutional, and political dimensions of emerging technologies in an effort to understand the social worlds that shape technological change.

While puppies and kittens and healthy adult dogs and cats are still euthanized in some shelters, euthanasia rates have dropped remarkably in the last decade. However, many animals are still bred and sold in the US in less than ideal conditions. The large population of free-roaming and feral cats is both a cause and effect of feline overpopulation; approaches to cat control are controversial and emotionally charged. Animal cruelty, abuse and neglect, including animal fighting and hoarding, represent issues with which veterinarians are becoming increasingly engaged in their communities. The number of well-intentioned pet owners seeking exotic companion animals as pets is increasing. As our community expands globally, welfare issues from abroad are also becoming more apparent.
